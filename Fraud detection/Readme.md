# Things to learn here : 
- How to so a proper EDA and visualize your data; accordingly and with normalizarion when scale is too big
- How to preprocess your data;  dealing with missing values, using scaling when ecart too big, splitting imbalanced datasets properly with stratification, sample selection methods (under without outliers and over sampling).
- Feature engineering 
- How to create a proper prediction model; visualize ler disposition in a reduced dimensionality (usign PCA, TSNE and SVD), exploring with classification models parameters and using a grisearch
- Evaluation methods : Metrics and visualisations. 


# Conclusions : 
## In EDA : 
- A flagrant Class Imbalance
## In preprocessing :
- When undersampling, selecting un echantillon with no extreme outliers helps create better data 
- SMOTE technique is used in oversampling
